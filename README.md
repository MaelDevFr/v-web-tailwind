**Web server in V with TailwindCSS**

Create a V web server with tailwindCSS, it's possible ! Follow this little guide :

> Clone the code : `git clone https://github.com/MaelDevFr/v-web-tailwind`
> Open the folder : `cd v-web-tailwind`
> Run the tailwindcss compiler : `make css`
> Open in another terminal window the folder
> Run the V code : `make run`

**Warning !**

Don't build the V code, tailwind don't work, I will try to fix that... (more work I love)

_In progress..._
